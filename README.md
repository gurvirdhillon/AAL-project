# Project-AAL

## About

This project is about ambient assisted living which is where elderly individuals are monitored using unobtrusive technologies such as smart devices.

This project aims to improve the quality of care for elderly using web and smart watch devices. The application aims to give an "all-in-one" application which will be discussed later in the feature set section.

## Technologies and tools used

* JavaScript
* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* SQLite
* FitbitAPI
* HTML & CSS

I created a HTML page and had used expressJS to start my server. I had used javascript to respond to clicks and to provide responses to
key tasks. I had used the FitbitAPI to communicate data of the users smart watch device. This had included things such as step count, heart rate, temperature and many other features that help the user in their daily activities.
